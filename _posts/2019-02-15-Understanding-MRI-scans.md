Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is imaging technique used by radiologist to take pictures of body. It uses strong magnetic field to generate images of organs of body. In few cases Gadolinium Contrast Medium is injected into the body so that radiologist can take enhanced quality images during MRI.

MRI machine takes multiple images in 3 different planes (sagittal, coronal and transverse plane).

The <b>sagittal</b> or lateral plane dives the body into left and right halves and is an x-z plane. Technically, the sagittal or median plane goes right through the middle between the bodyâ€™s left and right halves. It is called the sagittal plane because it goes through or is parallel to the sagittal suture, the line running along the top of the skull that marks where the left and right halves of the skull grew together.
