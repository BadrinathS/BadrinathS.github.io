<!--My updated resume can be found <a href="resume/Resume.pdf"> here </a>.-->
Currently I am learning a thing or two about stock markets, watching and predicting market is full of excitment and nervoursness. Lately I am finding financial world very interesting and I am trying to dive more into financial world by reading articles and theories behind some concepts. Participating in market can go either way, but knowing the principles behind how the market operates can slightly bend the situation to your favour. I am learning about market principles through <a href="https://zerodha.com/varsity/" target="_blank"> Zerodha's Varsity </a> and have completed few certifications.
