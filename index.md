Hi, I am currently working at<a href="https://embodyme.com/" target="_blank"> EmbodyMe </a> as a Machine Learning Scientist.
<br>
<br>
I graduated from <a href="https://iitg.ac.in" target="_blank"> Indian Institute of Tehnology Guwahati </a> majoring in  Electronics and Electrical Engineering with minor in Computer Science and Engineering. For my secondary and senior secondary education I attended <a href="https://amerigogcrpf.kvs.ac.in/" target="_blank"> Kendriya Vidyalaya C.R.P.F. Amerigog </a>.
<br>
<br>
During my junior year, I worked at <a href="http://fuzzy.hanyang.ac.kr/" target="_blank"> Computer Vision and Fuzzy Systems Lab</a> in <a href="https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng" target="_blank">Hanyang University </a> under the supervision of Prof. Frank Chung Hoon Rhee where I have worked in the field of Fuzzy logic with focus on "Interval Type 2 Fuzzy C Means Clustering algorithm". For my sophomore year, I worked at<a href="http://sacral.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/" target="_blank"> Ikegami Lab </a> in <a href="https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/" target="_blank"> The University of Tokyo</a>.

Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw&ab_channel=securitylectures">talk</a> from Richard Hamming about how to do great research, the talk is very practical and can be applied by any researcher across any field. I believe we can apply this to any career and not necessarily in research. Although I find the <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">transcript</a> of the talk more impactful than the video. Do listen to the lecture if you can. 


Currently I am learning a thing or two about stock markets, watching and predicting market is full of excitment and nervoursness. Lately I am finding financial world very interesting and I am trying to dive more into financial world by reading articles and theories behind some concepts. Participating in market can go either way, but knowing the principles behind how the market operates can slightly bend the situation to your favour. I am learning about market principles through <a href="https://zerodha.com/varsity/" target="_blank"> Zerodha's Varsity </a> and have completed few certifications.

Here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SQfsBsMFls&ab_channel=ItamarSegal">video</a> of Neil Patric Harris hosting the Tony Awards 2013, I love the video and watch it once in a while. Every time I watch this, it puts a smile on my face and I hope it does the same to you. 

Feel free to contact me if you want to discuss something or meet over coffee, I am also open to collaboration and suggestions.
