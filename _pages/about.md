Hi, Thanks for dropping on this site, below are some academic/professional details about me. Outside of professional life, I just try not to take things seriously. I enjoy cricket, running, comedy, food, tea, sunrise/sunset, mathematics etc.

Previously I worked at [Axera Tech](https://www.axera-tech.com/) and at [EmbodyMe](https://embodyme.com/) as a Machine Learning Scientist. And even before that I worked at [Synapsica](https://synapsica.com/).

I graduated from [Indian Institute of Tehnology Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/) majoring in Electronics and Electrical Engineering with minor in Computer Science and Engineering. For my secondary and senior secondary education I attended [Kendriya Vidyalaya C.R.P.F. Amerigog Guwahati](https://amerigogcrpf.kvs.ac.in/) .

======
Here is a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw&ab_channel=securitylectures) from Richard Hamming about how to do great research, the talk is very practical and can be applied by any researcher across any field. Tricks and tips suggested here can be interpolated to any aspect of life. Although I find the [transcript](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) of the talk more impactful than the video. Do listen (or read) the lecture if you can.



Here is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8SeysuMpA0&ab_channel=MattHagmeierCurtis) of Neil Patric Harris hosting the Tony Awards 2013, I love to watch this video every once in a while. Every time I watch this, it puts a smile on my face and I hope it does the same to you.

Feel free to contact me if you want to discuss something or meet over coffee! I am also open to collaborations and feedback.
