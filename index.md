Hi, Thanks for dropping on this site, below are some academic/professional details about me. Outside of professional life, I just try not to take things seriously. I enjoy cricket, running, comedy, food, tea, sunrise/sunset, mathematics etc.
<br>
<br>
Previously I worked at<a href="https://embodyme.com/" target="_blank"> EmbodyMe </a> as a Machine Learning Scientist. And even before that I worked at <a href="https://synapsica.com/" target="_blank"> Synapsica </a>. I've also done some contractual work outside of these stints for a brief period. 
<br>
<br>
I graduated from <a href="https://iitg.ac.in" target="_blank"> Indian Institute of Tehnology Guwahati </a> majoring in  Electronics and Electrical Engineering with minor in Computer Science and Engineering. For my secondary and senior secondary education I attended <a href="https://amerigogcrpf.kvs.ac.in/" target="_blank"> Kendriya Vidyalaya C.R.P.F. Amerigog </a>.
<br>
<br>
<!-- During my junior year, I worked at <a href="http://fuzzy.hanyang.ac.kr/" target="_blank"> Computer Vision and Fuzzy Systems Lab</a> in <a href="https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng" target="_blank">Hanyang University </a> under the supervision of Prof. Frank Chung Hoon Rhee where I have worked in the field of Fuzzy logic with focus on "Interval Type 2 Fuzzy C Means Clustering algorithm". For my sophomore year, I worked at<a href="http://sacral.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/" target="_blank"> Ikegami Lab </a> in <a href="https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/" target="_blank"> The University of Tokyo</a>. -->

Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw&ab_channel=securitylectures">talk</a> from Richard Hamming about how to do great research, the talk is very practical and can be applied by any researcher across any field. I believe we can apply this to any aspect of life and not necessarily in research. Although I find the <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">transcript</a> of the talk more impactful than the video. Do listen to the lecture if you can. 

Here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SQfsBsMFls&ab_channel=ItamarSegal">video</a> of Neil Patric Harris hosting the Tony Awards 2013, I love to watch this video every once in a while. Every time I watch this, it puts a smile on my face and I hope it does the same to you. 

Feel free to contact me if you want to discuss something or meet over coffee, I am also open to collaboration and suggestions.
